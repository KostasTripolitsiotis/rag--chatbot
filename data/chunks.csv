with MATLAB
Avoid costly equipment failures by using 
sensor data analytics
Predictive maintenance is the intelligent health monitoring of equipment 
to avoid future equipment failure. In contrast to preventive maintenance, 
which follows a set timeline, predictive maintenance schedules are 
determined by analytic algorithms and data from equipment sensors. 
With predictive maintenance, organizations can identify issues before"
1,"equipment fails, pinpoint the root cause of the failure, and schedule 
maintenance as soon as it’s needed.

Predictive Maintenance with MATLAB
MATLAB for Predictive Maintenance 
Today, more and more manufacturers and other organizations 
use MATLAB
® to develop and deploy monitoring and predictive 
maintenance software. With MATLAB they can analyze and 
visualize big data sets, implement advanced machine learning"
2,"algorithms, and run the algorithms in a production 
cloud environment. 
MATLAB provides an end-to-end solution for predictive 
maintenance. With MATLAB you can:
•	 Access and preprocess data from a variety of sources
•	 Develop predictive models using machine 
learning techniques
•	 Create dashboards for visualizing and interacting with the 
model results
•	 Deploy predictive maintenance algorithms in production 
systems and embedded devices"

“Our financial control department determined that we are saving up to 
50,000 euros a month by using MATLAB for predictive maintenance.  
That total is based on just eight machines. We expect that to increase at 
least fourfold as we analyze the data from more of our machines.”

Predictive Maintenance with MATLAB
Sensor data from equipment can reside in multiple sources such as"
4,"text files, spreadsheets, databases, and OPC servers.  Wherever 
your data is, you can get to it with MATLAB.  
But not all data is useful data. You start by preprocessing with 
MATLAB, using techniques such as:
•	 Time series data synchronization, to align data that is sampled 
at different rates and may contain missing values
•	 Advanced signal processing to remove noise from sensor data
•	 Feature selection, extraction, and transformation, to determine"
5,"which data will be the most helpful for predicting failures
Access and Preprocess Data
“We need to filter our data, look at poles and zeroes, run nonlinear 
optimizations, and perform numerous other tasks. In MATLAB, those 
capabilities are all integrated, robust, and commercially validated.”

Predictive Maintenance with MATLAB
Algorithms for data clustering, classification, and"
6,"system identification are critical to building successful 
predictive maintenance models. These models are typically 
trained and tested on input data in the form of temperature, 
pressure, voltage, noise, or vibration to: 
•	 Predict a specific failure 
•	 Monitor the health of the equipment
With MATLAB you can quickly iterate and try different 
algorithms. MATLAB apps let you: 
•	 Interactively explore your data
•	 Select the more important variables for your model"

•	 Assess and compare multiple models
“As a process engineer I had no experience with neural networks 
or machine learning. I worked through the MATLAB examples 
to find the best machine learning functions for generating virtual 
metrology. I couldn’t have done this in C or Python—it would’ve 
taken too long to find, validate, and integrate the right packages.”

Once you’ve developed your models, you want to get them up 
and running as quickly as possible.  MATLAB integrates into 
enterprise systems, clusters, and clouds, and can be targeted to 
real-time embedded hardware.
To shorten response times and send less data over the network, 
you can deploy the models directly on machines."

MATLAB lets you:
•	 Automatically generate code from models 
•	 Implement the code in an embedded system
•	 Target real-time hardware
To make results immediately available to operators on the

•	 Create analytics dashboards
•	 Deploy models in desktop applications
•	 Operationalize models in a server or cloud environment
“There’s a misconception that MATLAB is only for research or development. We operate our"

Industry Example
Truck with positive displacement pump.
Baker Hughes Develops Predictive Maintenance Software for Gas 
and Oil Extraction Equipment
Baker Hughes trucks are equipped with positive displacement 
pumps that inject a mixture of water and sand at high pressures 
deep into drilled wells. With pumps accounting for about 
$100,000 of the $1.5 million total cost of the truck, Baker Hughes"
12,"needed to determine when a pump was about to fail. Too-frequent 
maintenance wasted effort and resulted in still-usable parts being 
replaced, while too-infrequent maintenance risked damaging 
pumps beyond repair.
Working in MATLAB, Baker Hughes engineers developed 
pump health monitoring software that applies machine learning 
techniques in real time to predict the ideal time to perform 
maintenance. They processed and analyzed up to a terabyte"
13,"of data collected at 50,000 samples per second from sensors 
installed on 10 trucks operating in the field, identified the 
parameters that were useful in predicting failures, and created 
and trained a neural network to use sensor data to predict pump 
failures.
The software is expected to reduce maintenance costs by 
30–40%—or more than $10 million.
“MATLAB enabled us to perform our analyses and processing, 
including machine learning.  . . . If we had to write our own code"
14,"using lower-level language libraries for all the built-in MATLAB 
capabilities we needed, it would likely have taken an order of 
magnitude longer to complete this project.”

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Predictive maintenance (PM), often known as ""online 
monitoring,"" ""risk-based maintenance,"" or ""condition-
based maintenance,"" has been the focus of several recent 
research publications and has a long history (Erbiyik 
2022). It speaks of the careful monitoring of machinery to"
22,"prevent future breakdowns. The original method of 
predictive maintenance, visual inspection, has evolved into 
automated 
systems 
employing 
cutting-edge 
signal 
processing methodologies based on recognition of patterns 
and neural networks, fuzzy logic, machine learning, etc. 
(Benardos and Vosniakos 2003). Many companies can 
detect and gather sensitive information from equipment, 
primarily motors, using automated ways, although human"
23,"eyes and ears may no longer be able to do so. Predictive 
maintenance, when used in conjunction with integrated 
sensors, may decrease machine downtime, prevent 
needless equipment replacement, identify the source of a 
problem, and ultimately save money and increase

24,"planning the protection work to prevent machine 
breakdowns, predictive maintenance, and preventive 
maintenance 
has 
certain 
similarities. 
Predictive 
maintenance programs, as opposed rely on data acquired 
by sensors and analytical algorithms, as opposed to 
conventional preventive maintenance. (Cheng et al., 2020) 
Induction motors account for over seventy percent of all 
electricity-powered loads in process industries. In this"
25,"context, there has been a lot of interest in finding enhanced 
techniques to assess the health of these motors. The most 
prevalent reason for motor failure and the most frequent 
upkeep issue are both recognized as bearing failure. 
Predictive maintenance hence primarily emphasizes two 
points: increased energy efficiency and less unplanned 
downtime (Nacchia et al., 2021) 
 
The data-driven strategy sometimes addressed as the data 
mining strategy or the ML strategy employs historical data"
26,"to develop a model of machinery performance. When 
using a model-based methodology, it is possible to include 
a physical comprehension of the intended result since the 
analytical model is used to depict the system's behavior 
(Utting et al., 2012). In fields where data availability is 
growing, like maintenance in the industrial sector, machine 
learning techniques are successfully applied. It is 
progressively offering efficient solutions, cloud-based"
27,"solutions, and fresh algorithmic developments.  
The following two primary classifications may be used to 
categorize machine learning-based PM: Unsupervised 
which procedure data is provided but no protection data 
exists and Supervised which the data on the incidence of 
fault is contained in the modeling dataset (Calabrese et al., 
2019). The kind of present protection supervision policy 
mainly determines the convenience of maintenance data."
28,"The use of supervised solutions is advised wherever 
possible. Regression problems and classification problems 
are the two groups of supervised problems that are 
achievable from a machine-learning standpoint, based on 
the results of the data set. This research presents a novel 
PM strategy on a cutting machine based on PM machine 
learning. Given the growing requirement to reduce 
downtime and related costs, PM is an effective technique"
29,"for handling maintenance difficulties. Based on a genuine 
industrial group, for instance, the ENBANN has been used 
in an experimental setting to provide accurate estimations. 
 
2. RELATED WORKS 
 
The paper (Çınar et al., 2020) presented a systematic 
overview of the current developments of ML approaches 
that are extensively used in PM for smart manufacturing in 
I4.0 by categorizing the study according to the ML 
algorithms utilized. The article (Zonta et al., 2020)"
30,"provided an examination of the literature on Industry 4.0 
initiatives for preventative maintenance, identifying and 
categorizing methods, standards, and applications. A 
discussion of the current challenges and limitations in 
predictive maintenance, as well as a new taxonomy for 
classifying this area of research in light of Industry 4.0 
needs, are among the survey's major contributions. The 
study (Butte et al., 2018) explored a cutting-edge PM tactic"
31,"that makes use of machine learning. Several methods are 
explored for both posing and solving the PM issue. The 
effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms is 
assessed by analyzing equipment data. The article (Pech et 
al., 2021) presented a detailed review of current trends to 
aid in the organization and direction of future studies. At a 
similar 
moment,

The study (Zhang et al., 2019) aimed to give graduate 
students, businesses, and institutions a basic grasp of the 
recently published works by concentrating on data-driven 
approaches for predictive maintenance, providing a 
thorough assessment of its applications. The paper"
33,"(Zenisek et al., 2019) provided a machine learning-based 
method for discovering errant patterns of thought, or 
""concept drifts,"" in real-time information flows. Predictive 
Maintenance (PM) is a proactive method of triggering 
service procedures for industrial machinery, and it is this 
issue that inspired our work. The research (Makridis et al., 
2020) offered a method for anomaly identification on time-
series data that makes use of machine learning on the"
34,"sensor data from the vessel to enable predictive 
maintenance on the main engine. The research (Ayvaz and 
Alpay 2021) established a data-driven prognostic 
maintenance solution for manufacturing assembly lines 
was developed. The system is designed to utilize the real-
time data collected by IoT sensors to detect signs of 
probable problems using machine learning techniques.  
 
3. METHODOLOGY 
 
The Predictive Maintenance is a useful maintenance"
35,"device that anticipates problems by predicting the 
standards of certain quantities that illustrate a system 
using specific numerical models. The fundamental PM 
framework is as follows: 
 
Instantaneous measurement of physical quantities. 
 
Parameters that may be measured or estimated are 
estimated at time t + dt. 
 
Detection of the abnormal or malfunctioning state 
of the system. 
 
Preventative and corrective measures are planned 
for implementation before a system's critical"
36,"for implementation before a system's critical 
condition is reached. 
 
The following are some examples of predictive 
maintenance: 
 Deterioration of bearings or mechanical part 
deformation can cause a machine to vibrate. 
 When a motor's temperature and drown current start 
to rise, it might be a sign that friction and or 
mechanical failure are reducing its efficiency.

37,"57 
 The many particles in a lubricant may be used to 
determine how well rubbing contact components are 
holding up. It is feasible to test the lubricating oils 
composition and assess the machine's health using 
the right sensors. 
 
The estimation of the parameters forms the foundation 
of the initial stage of these operations. The technique 
can produce accurate projections based on PM. It will 
be challenging to spot abnormalities and decide on"
38,"maintenance and repair if the prediction algorithms 
generate inaccurate predictions or with too wide of 
reliability ranges. The forecasts often fall into one of 
two categories: Predicting trends across time and 
comparing different periods. 
 
3.1. Cross-Sectional Prediction 
 
In cross-sectional forecasting, factors for which there are 
no data are estimated using measurements on other 
variables that have been observed. By measuring the"
39,"electric current that flows through an electronic component 
while it is used in a specific environment, for instance, it 
may be feasible to estimate how long it will last. 
 
3.2. Predictions Based on Time Series 
 
Predicting time series is the process of estimating variables 
that vary eventually. The parameters are measured up to 
time instantaneous t, and the forecasted variable is at time 
immediate t + dt. It is characteristically feasible to anticipate"
40,"future values by taking regular intervals of measuring the 
variable of interest. The most straightforward illustration is 
the estimation of our cell phones' remaining battery life, 
which is based on our usage patterns and past consumption. 
It is common practice to identify: Trends or a long-term 
increase (or decrease) in values. 
 The seasonal phenomena or the phenomena that 
determine value changes through time with a 
constant cycle of the same length."
41,"constant cycle of the same length. 
 Cyclical phenomena create variations in values that 
don't always last for the same amount of time, or that 
aren't periodic. 
 
The nature of the relationship between the measured 
numbers is one of the most crucial concepts to comprehend 
while interpreting data. This may be accomplished by using 
graphic visualization with dispersed plots to show how the 
data are interdependent. The idea behind linear regression is"
42,"that the behavior of the evaluating phenomenon is linear. 
Analyzing the residuals is an easy technique to determine 
whether the signal we wish to anticipate is linear or includes 
data not included in our prediction model. 
 
3.3. Investigation of the residuals 
 
The residuals represent the discrepancy among the size's 
observed variables and those derived by fitting the 
prediction line. 
𝑓𝑗= 𝑥𝑗−𝑥′𝑗  
 
(1) 
Here 𝑓𝑗 is the measurement's residual, 𝑥𝑗 is the value"
43,"that was measured, and 𝑧′𝑗= 𝑛′𝑠𝑗+ 𝑟′ 0 is the 
variable that was calculated at time𝑠𝑗. The least 
square approach is used to determine the coefficients 
m and q. Autocorrelation is a useful tool for 
determining either the generated regression model 
meets the signal to be forecasted. By counting the 
number of residuals whose values fall inside the 
interval, it is possible to compute the autocorrelation 
of the residues obtained above: 
𝐼𝑛𝑡= ±
2
√𝑀   
 
 
              (2)"
44,"𝐼𝑛𝑡= ±
2
√𝑀   
 
 
              (2) 
Where M is the total value of capacity. Typically, it is 
assumed that if >95% of the residuals are contained 
within the ±𝐼𝑛𝑡, then the noise may be classified as 
white noise since there is no correlation between the 
residuals. This method enables the development of 
algorithms for signal prediction using linear regression, 
is helpful for predictive maintenance, and automatically 
checks any alterations of the system being observed in"
45,"real-time. The test of residuals may also be used to 
determine whether linear regression is the better option 
for the desired prediction model. 
 
3.3. Predictive maintenance using machine learning 
A plan outlining the steps and technical tasks needed to 
deploy PM is shown in Figure 2. The data gathered by 
the I4.0 and MES machine layers may be used to 
execute the Machine Learning phase of the PM (Figure 
2). Three crucial data sources must be located to"
46,"determine if an issue is suitable for a predictive 
maintenance solution.

58 
3.4. Problem history 
 
In predictive maintenance systems, error occurrences 
are often quite infrequent. However, the algorithm must 
be trained to learn both the standard functioning system 
and the fault system to build predictive models that"
47,"forecast failures. Therefore, the training data must have 
adequate several instances in each category. 
 
3.4. Repair and maintenance history 
 
The thorough asset of maintenance history, which 
includes data on replacement components, completed 
preventive maintenance chores, etc., is a crucial data 
source for solutions including predictive maintenance. 
 
3.5. Repair and maintenance history 
 
It is assumed that a machine's health condition"
48,"It is assumed that a machine's health condition 
deteriorates with time to calculate how many days (or 
hours, kilometers, etc.) it will endure before breaking 
down. Therefore, the data must include time-varying 
functions that develop aging patterns or other 
abnormalities that could lead to a decline in 
performance. 
 
 It is important to carry out certain pre-processing 
processes to get the information into the format 
needed to make the functions that will be contained"
49,"in the ml techniques. 
 The first is to split the time required for data 
gathering into discrete units, with every record 
history representing a discrete unit of time for a 
given asset. The general data model may be: 
 Maintenance history: This is the documentation of 
the upkeep tasks completed. Untreated protection 
data is often linked to an asset ID and a timestamp 
that contains details on the maintenance tasks 
completed at that moment. Maintenance actions"
50,"completed at that moment. Maintenance actions 
need to be converted from unprocessed data each 
representing a particular kind of maintenance work, 
into category columns for time, maintenance, and 
asset IDs actions that will be included in the basic 
data structure for maintenance records. 
 Failure Records: These are records that pertain to the 
evaluation aim, eg., failure or faults. They might be 
particular error messages or errors that are caused by"
51,"particular operational circumstances. In other 
instances, the data contains many error codes, some 
of which are associated with important defects. 
Others are often used to develop functions that can 
be associated with failures because not all faults are 
the target of an estimate. The columns for time fault 
and asset ID, or cause for fault if a pattern is 
provided, will be included in the base data format 
for failure records. 
 Machine

 Machine and operator information: the assets

attributes of the assets and the operator, may be 
identified by combining this data in a plan.

A list of data is presented in Table I together with the

the functions is the initial stage in modeling. 
Conceptually speaking, the concept of generating 
functions entails leveraging past data amassed up to 
that point to describe and abstract the integrity status"
55,"of a machine at a specific moment. However, the 
approaches for designing the functions that are given 
here can be utilized as a starting point for developing 
functions. The creation of delay (lag) functions from 
data sources, such as timestamps, as well as standing 
operations from static sources of data, with instances 
from the illustrative use cases, is required in the 
following. 
The 
chronological 
data 
used 
for 
preventative maintenance often include timestamps"
56,"that show when each data point was collected. A 
window with the size ""W"" that corresponds to the 
several time units for which we wish to evaluate the 
chronological aggregations is chosen for each asset 
record. The W periods before the record's creation 
date are then used to construct the aggregate 
sequencing 
functions. 
Examples 
of 
sequential 
aggregations include peaks, trend changes, and level 
changes using methods that identify anomalies, mean,"
57,"and outliers based on normal deviations, increasing 
total observations, maximum and minimum window 
values, etc.

3.5. Enhanced naïve bayes artificial neural 
network (ENBANN) 
 
The Enhanced Naive Bayesian method was developed 
based on Bayesian decision theory. The variables of the 
dependent and prior probabilities are calculated based"
58,"on historical data. The Bayesian formula is then used to 
calculate the posterior probability distribution, and the 
likelihood that an event belongs to a certain category 
may be detected by comparing the possibilities. The 
basic framework is 
𝑂(𝑌) = 𝑂(𝐷)
𝑂(𝐶)
𝑂(𝑌), 
 
 
              (3) 
Where O is the probability. We assume that there are m 
judgment 
categories 
𝐷= {𝐷1,𝐷2, … . . 𝐷𝑛 } 
and 
n 
characteristic features 𝑌= {𝑌1,𝑌2, … . . , 𝑌𝑚} in each fire"
59,"dataset. By assuming that 𝑂(𝑌) is constant over all 
possible categories, we may arrive at the naive Bayesian 
classification model. 
 
𝐷𝑀𝐴(𝑊) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑜(𝐷𝑗) ∏𝑚
𝑙=1
𝑜(𝐷𝑗)             (4)
 
 
 
 
Here 𝑜(𝐷𝑗) is the expected value of the choice 
categories and (𝐷𝑗) is the possibility that 𝑊𝑙 has the 
value x if Ci is the decision category. For every given 
dataset, Y, the prior probability of assigning it to one of 
the classes 𝛶= {𝑧1,𝑧2, … . . 𝑧𝑚} is obtained from the"
60,"data itself. The conditional possibility of every feature is 
compounded 
under 
every 
option 
category𝐷𝑗. 
Multiplying the prior possibility 𝑜(𝛶)by the conditional 
possibility 𝑜(𝛶)yields the posterior probability𝑜(𝛶). 
The highest posterior probability is chosen as the class 
the item belongs to 𝑜(𝛶)𝑚𝑎𝑥. 
 
The ENBANN is a collection of neurons with 
unidirectional links between them that may mimic the 
brainpower capacity for pattern recognition and"
61,"brainpower capacity for pattern recognition and 
association learning in data. Each neuron 𝑗 has an 
activated function 𝜃𝑖 associated with it, and each 
connection among neurons 𝑗,𝑖 has a weight 𝑢𝑗𝑖 given to 
it that regulates how much impact neuron j has on 
neuron𝑖. The weighted connections between the 
neurons, which stand in for the fundamental processing 
units of an ENBANN, enable the modeling of 
complicated interactions. Normally, the neurons are"
62,"arranged in layers, and each layer's neurons are 
connected directly to the layers above it (Figure 2). The 
levels in between are referred to as ""hidden layers,"" 
while the initial layer is well-known as the ""input layer"" 
and the final one as the ""output layer."" The initial hide 
layer receives the input information from the input 
layer, where it aggregates and transforms them as 
follows: 
𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖= ∑𝑗∈𝑂𝑖
𝑢𝑗𝑖𝑃𝑗  
 
(5) 
Where 𝑂𝑖 is the collection of neurons that had linked to"
63,"neuron i, 𝑃𝑗 is the output of neuron I, and wij is the 
weight of the link connecting neuron 𝑗 and i. The 
following formula is used to determine a neuron's 
output. 
𝑃𝑗=  𝜙 (𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑗)

The 
hyperbolic 
tangent 
function, 
with 
the 
formula𝑒(𝑦) =
𝑓𝑦−𝑓−𝑦
𝑓𝑦+𝑓−𝑦, is a typical activation function. 
This function is very helpful since it may be both 
continual and distinct, which are requirements for"
64,"determining the network error gradient. The neurons in 
the subsequent layer get each neuron's output after that. 
This process is continued for each additional layer until 
the network's output layer is reached. The output layer's 
output corresponds to the network's overall output.

An ENBANN connection weights must be changed to 
simulate non-linear relations. The usual method for 
doing this entails two steps. Back propagation is used to"

observation in the initial step. The error function 
determines the error signal. Regression's error function 
is written as 𝐹=

overall number of goal values, 𝑃𝑗 is the output neuron j 
and 𝑠𝑖 is the goal value. The error function leads to the 
calculation of the error signal as follows:

71,"4. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
 
The 
aforementioned 
techniques 
for 
predictive 
maintenance have been applied to actual cutting-edge 
woodworking technology that is a machining center for 
the firewood industry. The primary goals of the 
suggested test are to assess the suggested method for 
machine learning PM of the machine using analysis of 
Fingerprints, which includes vibration data analysis to 
gauge spindle health status and drive data analysis for"
72,"axis monitoring. A data set of 530731 data reading on 
15 distinct machine features were adjusted for the 
suggested feature set, which is presented in Table I, and 
the data was acquired from the tried and true cutter in 
real-time. The method of gathering data takes into 
account several data sources, and the following general 
architecture was created: 
 Flight Recorder: The MCM machine tool is 
equipped with an industrial PC. It's having"
73,"equipped with an industrial PC. It's having 
conversations with different parts of the system to 
get the information it needs for the study. 
 IT Accelerometer: A vibration data-collecting 
accelerometer with an interface for simple data 
export, 
the 
Information 
Technological 
Accelerometer may be attached to the spindle head 
of MCM machines. 
As for the introduction of the top-level architecture: 
 The computer hosting the analysis of data software"
74,"that can be used is known as the data analysis unit. 
 Simulation Unit is a Machine Learning Studio-based 
Azure Cloud architecture that houses the ML 
software. 
 
The three distinct data sources for the Flight Recorder 
system are listed below. 
 
Drive 
data: 
Through 
a 
D.Electron-developed 
communication protocol, they are sampled in real-time 
by the CNC and prepared accessible to the Flight 
Recorder. The CNC at the moment of sampling"
75,"Recorder. The CNC at the moment of sampling 
associates this data with a time reference (timestamp). 
 
Input/output signal: Similar to drive data, they are 
collected in actual time by the machine PLC and made 
available to the Flight Recorder. 
 
Vibration data: To effectively monitor the spindle unit, 
vibration analysis in the frequency domain is carried 
out. 
The 
Flight 
Recorder 
needs 
a 
specialized 
sensor/electronic system that, after each fingerprinting"
76,"or operational incident, provide both raw data about the 
trend in the vibration spectrum and an assessment of 
how much the detected spectrum deviates from the 
typical spectrum contain under ideal functioning 
conditions. 
 
The suggested architecture was used to analyze all the 
data obtained, with 40% of the data set serving as a 
training set and the remaining 60% being used to assess 
the findings. Using various metrics, including accuracy,"
77,"precision, and recall, we compared some of the current 
approaches, such as CNN, RNN, and A2LSTM, with 
our novel approach, ENBANN. 
 
Predictive maintenance accuracy refers to a model's or 
system's capacity to correctly forecast the occurrence of 
equipment faults or maintenance requirements. The 
comparison of accuracy between the current and our 
suggested methods is shown in Figure 3 and Table 2.

other existing methods."

The capacity of a predictive maintenance model or"
79,"system to precisely identify true positive situations, or 
in other words, to properly forecast equipment failures 
or maintenance requirements, is referred to as precision 
in predictive maintenance. The percentage of optimistic 
forecasts that come true positively is measured by this 
performance statistic. The comparison of precision 
between the current and our suggested methods is 
shown in Figure 4 and Table 3. And it depicts that our"
80,"proposed method is higher than other existing methods.

5. CONCLUSION 
 
This research presents a novel ENBANN strategy on a 
cutting machine based on PM machine learning. Given the 
growing necessity to reduce downtime and related costs, 
PM is an effective technique for handling maintenance"
83,"difficulties. The approach has been used in an experimental 
setting using a real-world industrial group as an example, 
yielding precise estimates. Data analysis tool offers access 
to data that has been collected by a variety of sensors, 
machine PLCs, and protocols for communication. By 
training an ENBANN technique on Azure Machine 
Learning Studio, the PM methodology enables the adoption 
of dynamic decision rules for maintenance management."
84,"The first results show that the approach works as intended 
by accurately predicting different states of the machine with 
a high accuracy of 95% using a dataset of 530731 data 
readings on fifteen dissimilar machine variables obtained in 
actual duration from the tested cutting machine. The main 
spindle rotor state prediction accuracy achieved by the 
papers is high, and the basic cloud architecture for Industry 
4.0 is shown. Additionally, ML approaches are used to a"
85,"factual data set from machines in the field. Future studies 
will concentrate on improving data reliability, exploring 
other failure situations, and studying an expanded range of 
features, especially in the frequency domain.

Big Data Analytics for 
Predictive Maintenance 
Strategies
ABSTRACT
Maintenance aims to reduce and eliminate the number of failures occurred during 
production as any breakdown of machine or equipment may lead to disruption for"
122,"the supply chain. Maintenance policy is set to provide the guidance for selecting the 
most cost-effective maintenance approach and system to achieve operational safety. 
For example, predictive maintenance is most recommended for crucial components 
whose failure will cause severe function loss and safety risk. Recent utilization of 
big data and related techniques in predictive maintenance greatly improves the 
transparency for system health condition and boosts the speed and accuracy in the"
123,"maintenance decision making. In this chapter, a Maintenance Policies Management 
framework under Big Data Platform is designed and the process of maintenance 
decision support system is simulated for a sensor-monitored semiconductor manu-
facturing plant. Artificial Intelligence is applied to classify the likely failure patterns 
and estimate the machine condition for the faulty component.

INTRODUCTION
Maintenance can be defined as all actions which are necessary to retain or restore a 
system and a unit to a state, which is necessary to fulfill its intended function. The 
main objective of maintenance is to preserve the capability and the functionality"
125,"of the system while controlling the cost induced by maintenance activities and the 
potential production loss. Correspondingly, failures can be defined as any change 
or anomaly in the system causing an unsatisfactory level of performance. Although 
only certain failures will cause severe risk in productivity and safety, most failures 
lead to disruptive, inconvenient, and expensive breakdowns and loss of quality."
126,"Maintenance plans are designed to reduce or eliminate the number of failures and 
the costs related to them.
There are two broadly accepted methodologies aiming at continuously enhanc-
ing maintenance excellence, with different focuses. As a human factor manage-
ment oriented policy, total productive maintenance (TPM) involves all employees, 
especially the operators, in the maintenance program in order to achieve optimality"
127,"in overall effectiveness and zero breakdowns. Through the operators’ participation 
in maintenance, such as through inspections, cleaning, lubricating and adjusting, 
early detection of hidden defects, before service breakdown. TPM aims to diminish 
and eliminate six significant losses of equipment effectiveness – i.e. breakdowns, 
setup and adjustment, idling and stoppages, reduced speed, defects in process, and 
reduced yield (Jardine & Tsang, 2013)."
128,"reduced yield (Jardine & Tsang, 2013).
Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is another approach to strengthening 
the system’s reliability, availability and efficiency which focuses on design and 
technology. RCM program is based on systematic assessment of maintenance needs 
after a complete understanding of the system function and the types of failure caus-
ing function losses.
Types of Maintenance
Maintenance activities can be categorized into three types:
1."
129,"1. 	
Reactive or corrective maintenance,
2. 	
Preventive maintenance (PvM), and
3. 	
Predictive maintenance (PdM).
The following terms are also respectively used for the above three categories 
interchangeably as:
1. 	
Breakdown maintenance or unplanned maintenance,
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
52
2. 	
Planned maintenance, and
3. 	
Condition based maintenance (CBM) or prognostic and health management 
(PHM)."
130,"(PHM).
Reactive or corrective maintenance follows the run-to-failure methodology, which 
is the repair and/or replacement work after an equipment outage has occurred. This 
primitive maintenance approach, which has been applied in industry for decades, 
and is still considered the best maintenance policy for non-critical components with 
short repairing time in the system. However, in most cases, an equipment failure can"
131,"lead to unexpected production delay and lower the production efficacy rate, or more 
seriously, cause severe damage to other components and/or injury to people. One 
goal of a proactive maintenance plan is to reduce the overall requirement for reac-
tive maintenance and to apply PvM and/or PdM strategies on any feasible occasion.
Preventive maintenance is performed based on a certain periodic interval to 
prevent and correct problems before breakdown without considering the actual"
132,"health condition of a system. Basic preventive maintenance, including inspections, 
lubrication, cleaning and adjustment is the first step to be undertaken. After that, 
rectification or replacement can be undertaken only for components identified with 
defects and/or considerable risk of failure. Generally, most PvM actions can be 
implemented by operators with basic training.
Predictive maintenance is a trend-oriented policy that begins with identifying the"
133,"states of each component within the equipment. PdM greatly relies on engineering 
techniques and statistical tools to process the data and analyze the health condition 
in order to predict possible equipment failure (Lee, Ardakani, Yang, & Bagheri, 
2015). The prediction of the equipment condition is based on the finding that most 
types of failures, which occur after a certain degradation process from a normal 
state to abnormalities, do not happen instantaneously (Fu et al., 2004). Through"
134,"degradation monitoring and failure prediction, PdM reduces the uncertainty of 
maintenance activities and enables identifying and solving problems before potential 
damage. Condition-based maintenance, the alternative term for PdM, imposes more 
emphasis on real-time inspections using RFID devices and wireless sense networks 
(WSNs). The three key steps of CBM are monitoring and processing, diagnosis and 
prognosis, and maintenance decision making.
BIG DATA ACHITECTURE"
135,"BIG DATA ACHITECTURE
Big Data is not only a matter of volume increased of the collected data, but also 
includes the evolution of data peculiarities, namely data variety and data velocity. 
The intrinsic pattern of comprehensive data becomes the major driver for compa-
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
53
nies to investigate the use of big data analytics. The features of big data are broadly"
136,"recognized as “4Vs” – i.e. volume, velocity, variety and value (Xin & Ling, 2013).
•	
Data Volume: Data volume is the primary attribute of data. Due to the dra-
matically boost in data volume and the rising demand of data storage, data-
base management has been modified as petabyte-scale data management. The 
storage needs can be easily satisfied by increasing data warehouse capacities 
but at the same time, the data transfer and processing will become too slow to"
137,"be operated and handled by a single computer. Therefore, a super-computer 
or high capacity server is required for operation. On the other hand, the cost is 
also a major concern for implementing with advanced computing equipment. 
The data growth in the supply chain and logistics system becomes too large 
and too complex in the traditional data warehouse and system architecture. 
In addition, big data analytics makes good use of multiple modes during the"
138,"computation. This Big Data Analytics method can handle large volume data.
•	
Data Velocity: With the use of automatic data retrieval systems (e.g. sen-
sor network, wireless network and electronic data interchange through the 
Intranet and Internet), the speed of data transaction is rapidly increased. 
Moreover, this allows companies to collect instant information and accelerate 
the speed of data production and streaming. The data transfer and transfor-"
139,"mation are more intensive nowadays. If the company chooses to extract real 
time information from several automatic data retrieval systems, the speed of 
data processing from big data must be as expeditious as possible to meet the 
requirement of quick response.
•	
Data Variety: The analytics process of data mining has been expanded from 
structured data to unstructured data, typically the images, videos, audio and 
text, etc. The systematic relationship is longer limited by numerical results,"
140,"but also prohibits pattern finding in unstructured data. This motivates com-
panies to investigate semi-structured and unstructured data for their decision 
making process. The major purpose of big data analytics is to resolve the 
problem of incompatible data formats and non-aligned data structures of un-
structured data with data mining techniques.
•	
Data Value: Big data analytics creates value for data mining in order to find"
141,"the intrinsic and multidimensional attributes from the enormous amounts of 
data. To a certain extent, a big data-driving model can perform as a support 
vector machine to establish supervised learning, which allows the model to 
adapt and evolve from time to time. Value creation is a significant process 
contributing to organizations’ continuous improvement and demand predic-
tion. We need to understand that big data analytics is not only in statistical"
142,"analytics, but also in more complicated and tailor-made analytics. In general, 
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
54
big data analytics come into existence for resolving data storage problems as 
well as providing valuable insights for organizations.
The acquisition and processing of big data largely improves the transparency 
along the supply chains providing accurate and timely information for managerial"
143,"decision making. Companies and organizations operate on the huge amounts of 
data by classifying trends and identifying patterns to produce invaluable knowledge.
Meanwhile the flood of big data with high speed and many variations has chal-
lenged the limited storage and conventional data mining methods. Challenges are 
also from processing and analyzing the large amount of unstructured data which are 
the major components in the big data acquired. Technologies have been advancing"
144,"towards better performance in the big data context regarding integrated platforms, 
predictive analytics, and visualization (Lee, Kao, & Yang, 2014). Big data and 
predictive analysis are strongly interconnected. Without proper analytics, big data 
is just a deluge of data, while without big data, predictive analytics, the strength 
of statistics, modeling, and data mining tools for analyzing current and historical 
conditions will be undermined.
BIG DATA ANALYTICS"
145,"conditions will be undermined.
BIG DATA ANALYTICS
The descriptive tasks of big data analytics identify the common characteristics of 
data with the purpose of deriving patterns and relationships existed in the data. The 
descriptive functions of big data mining include classification analysis, clustering 
analysis, association analysis, and logistic regression.
•	
Classification Analysis: Classification is a typical learning models used in"
146,"big data analytics, which aims to build a model for making prediction on data 
feature from the predefined set of classes according to certain criteria. A rule-
base classification is used to extract IF-THEN rules to classify as different 
categories. The examples include neural network, decision trees and support 
vector machine.
•	
Clustering Analysis: Clustering analysis is defined as the process of group-
ing data into separate cluster of similar objects, which helps to segment and"
147,"acquire the data features. Data can be divided into different subgroups ac-
cording to the characteristics. The practitioners may formulate appropriate 
strategies for different clusters. The common example of clustering technique 
are K-means algorithm, self-organizing map, hill climbing algorithm and 
density-based spatial clustering.
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
55
•	
Association analysis: Association model helps the practitioners to recognize"
148,"groups of items that occur synchronously. Association algorithm is devel-
oped for searching frequent sets of items with minimum specified confidence 
level. The criteria support and confidence level helps to identify the most 
important relationships among the related items.
•	
Regression Analysis: Regression represents the logical relationship of the 
historical data. The focus in regression analysis is to measure the dependent"
149,"variable given one or several independent variables, which support the con-
ditional estimation of expected outcome using the regression function. Linear 
regression, non-linear regression and exponential regression are the common 
statistical method to measure the best fit for a set of data.
MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES
The Big Data platform has the ability to handle huge amounts of data in manufactur-
ing or production logistics databases along with the development of computerized"
150,"maintenance management systems (CMMS), which assist decisions making so as 
to formulate maintenance strategies.
Maintenance procedures will be undertaken when a machine failure has occurred 
in the CrM strategy. Manufacturers are required to keep components inventories 
for maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) in order to prevent disruption of the 
overall production by failure of machine parts or equipment. Compared to the CrM"
151,"strategy, maintenance performance in the PvM strategy follows a fixed time, interval 
basis or condition based schedules to avoid fatal machine failure. The design of PvM 
is a protective, process-oriented approach in which machine failure and downtime 
cost could be reduced by taking proper prevention and prevention to smoothen the 
production. Decisions on maintenance schedules is based on a machine’s physical"
152,"properties or asset condition. Extra resources are spent on non-value-added activi-
ties to estimate and measure the condition rules for PvM (Exton & Labib, 2002). 
However, PvM attempts to provide an empirical basis for the development of a 
framework design of manufacturing flexibility at machine idle periods and during 
maintenance activities. The assumption behind a PvM policy is that the machine 
failure follows the bathtub curve in Figure 1. Scheduled maintenance happen in the"
153,"wear-out phase in order to reduce the failure rate (Sikorska, Hodkiewicz, & Ma, 
2011). However, the most conspicuous deficiency in PvM is still the apparent ran-
dom failure within the useful life period. The impact of failure in a critical machine 
is a tremendous risk to the downtime costs and, it in turn becomes bottleneck in 
production logistics operations.
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
56
To remedy random machine failure in maintenance management, PdM has been"
154,"well developed carrying out observation of the machine degradation process and 
symptoms from normal to flawed situations (Wu, Gebraeel, Lawley, & Yih, 2007). 
PdM is a sensor-based content-awareness philosophy based on the foundation of 
“Internet of Things”. The intelligent maintenance prediction support system moni-
tors the machine status by utilizing real time sensory data (Kaiser & Gebraeel, 2009). 
Advance maintenance in PdM policy is able to provide insights for maintenance"
155,"scheduling in advance in order to eliminate unanticipated machine breakdowns, and 
minimize maintenance costs as well as downtime, before the occurrence of random 
machine failure (Garcia, Sanz-Bobi, & del Pico, 2006).
The important factors associated with PdM in Maintenance Policy Management 
(MPM) emphases criticality, availability of sensory data, reliability, timeliness, 
relevance and knowledge-oriented strategy.
•"
156,"relevance and knowledge-oriented strategy.
•	
Criticality in Failures: PdM strategy has been heavily concentrated in real 
time machine condition monitoring through diagnostics and prognostics for 
reimbursement of foreseeable machine downtime cost. In reliability study, 
the critical assets must have a higher rank in priority formulate PdM strategy 
to predict the most likely time for the next machine breakdown and random"
157,"error, as this will have the greatest impact on the production operations This

(Klutke, Kiessler, & Wortman, 2003)

57
changes the maintenance objective from avoiding breakdown to accepting 
downtime and taking maintenance action ahead of the schedule.
•	
Availability of Sensory Data: PdM policy is highly dependent on extract-
transform-load (ETL) operational data in close condition-based monitoring."
158,"The current operational status and abnormal performance could be assessed 
by equipping sensors to identify failure modules or machines. Lack of sen-
sory data may result in unpromising maintenance prediction.
•	
Reliability: Maintaining critical machine performance and leveraging the 
overall cost to sustain production are the major targets of PdM policy. The 
system must provide the correct measures and reliable performance in pre-"
159,"diction to address feasible and foreseeable machine failure, and build confi-
dence in operation.
•	
Timeliness: The prediction for maintenance modules must have a high level 
of confidence level before the undesired event occurs, and the data size and 
data transmission speed administered in a timely manner. The time series of 
the maintenance schedule and delivery of MRO should be taken into con-
sideration the maintenance management in order to facilitate the production,"
160,"with zero tolerance of equipment failure.
•	
Relevance: The MPM system needs to be developed based on the opinions of 
experts. The collected sensory information must be recorded and analyzed on 
a real time basis. In order to improve data quality, extraction of relevant data 
for maintenance decision making is crucial in regard to engineering aspects. 
Inappropriate integration of a sensor and machine may cause poor estimation 
and inaccuracy prediction of the current machine performance.
•"
161,"•	
Knowledge-Objective Oriented Strategy: The concept of the PdM strategy 
involves a belief that the implicit knowledge from collaboration of sensory 
information did contribute to the maintenance in advanced. The knowledge 
transfer system facilitates the disclosure of implicit information to maximize 
production efficiency and minimizes the adverse impact of idling time un-
der maintenance and unawareness of potential failure. The decision of PdM"
162,"policy could be assessed by the involvement of Big Data Mining Techniques 
to detect and defeat anomalies at an early stage.
PREDICTIVE MAINTENENACE IN BIG DATA FRAMEWORK
The ideology of a PdM is to create transparency of the machine condition and in 
the utilization of available information for maintenance decision making. In Figure 
2, the framework of a big data platform in PdM is designed for closer integration 
of data acquisition and the maintenance decision support system (MDSS), which"
163,"Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
58
highlights the dataflow process in diagnostics and prognostics modeling for PdM. 
Case examples are provided in the following section to describe the framework of 
MPM for a semiconductor machine under Big Data Platform, and operations of 
MDSS. The operating data from vibration, heat and pressure sensors, which provide 
sensory information stored in the Big Database, are embedded on the semiconductor"
164,"machine to evaluate the machine condition. The diagnostics and prognostics pro-
cess may involve real time data and historical data for data mining procedures. The 
advantage of Big Data Architecture are capable to manage huge units of data and 
perform ETL in a timely manner by using appropriate data processing algorithms, 
such as Map-Reduce technique. The Big Data platform can build an intelligent agent 
Figure 2. Predictive maintenance model in big data platform"
165,"Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
59
to connect the PdM module and the sensor knowledge from the actual machine. 
The PdM module consists of two major systems: a diagnostics system and a prog-
nostics system. PdM analysis is a powerful tool to identify machine/components 
failure, and provide surprisingly accurate future breakdown using time-series data 
by well-developed analytic processes. The predictive maintenance module closely"
166,"supervises the machine condition and constantly aids the analytics process of di-
agnosis and prognosis. The results from Artificial Intelligence (AI) will then be 
further processed and evaluated by the MDSS. Certain operational guidance and 
estimation of failure events, such as foreseeable situations, time to breakdown and 
estimated downtime, are recommended for maintenance decision making. With the 
implementation of the big data platform, more precise sensory data acquisition and"
167,"accurate maintenance decisions could be made from the suggested algorithms in 
order to manage critical machines, with the objectives of maintenance in advanced 
or just-in-time (JIT) maintenance for supply chain management.
It is practical for a decision makers to select appropriate analytic processes and 
recognize the functionalities of algorithms for maintenance planning. Therefore, a 
comprehensive discussion of algorithm design is presented herein. The common"
168,"practices of AI techniques can be classified as Knowledge Based System (KBS), 
Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML) (Faiz & Edirisinghe, 2009).
•	
Knowledge Based System: These types of analytics process require logical 
deduction and cognitive reasoning to resolve complex problems and support 
decision making. KBS attempts to extract rules for algorithm contexts by 
human intelligence and expert opinion, which are of practical significance."
169,"The practical necessity of KBS is increased due to the advancement of sen-
sor-based PdM. KBS encourages a more flexible way to increase quality in 
problem solving and in extracting relevant data into knowledge for decision 
making, i.e., machine failure identification, classification in maintenance 
policies. A variation of sensory information causes data-booming in the ana-
lytics process. The rule-based and inference engine expert system have the"
170,"ability to simulate a human expert in reducing the complexity in MPM and in 
discovering hidden machine failures.
•	
Data Mining: The goal of the DM process is to create a constructive model 
of patterns recognition and feature analysis, which is able to classify data 
into groups, detect irregular features and measure the dependencies of data. 
Moving toward a total productive manufacturing system, DM is an instru-
ment that is able to mine all kinds of manufacturing knowledge, such as job"
171,"shop scheduling, manufacturing process, quality control, yield improvement, 
and even predictive maintenance strategy. In the data mining technique, the 
accuracy of the information discovered increases along with the increase in 
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
60
gathered data from the sensors and the historical maintenance data, which is 
able to foresee failure from pattern behavior of the operating machine data 
and the increased reliability of MDSS.
•"
172,"and the increased reliability of MDSS.
•	
Machine Learning: ML is another dimension of the analytics process. The 
mechanism of KBS and DM are either to discover knowledge and insight 
beforehand for the working process of the algorithm, which is concerned in-
formation and knowledge extraction from massive data. However, ML deals 
with automatic reasoning and artificial cognitive resolution by an intelligence 
agent. ML works as an online measurement of a health detection system to re-"
173,"veal machine degradation and anomalies from the models. Self-learning and 
reinforcement in ML, together with normal degradation allow the forecasting 
of random machine failure effectively and efficiently in order to plan for the 
best before failure occurs.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
DIAGNOSTICS AND PROGNOSTICS
In most cases, there is a measureable process of degradation before a machine fails. 
Figure 3 illustrates the degradation process of a system, sub-system, or component"
174,"into failure. Through functioning life, the system may continuously degrade to a 
condition with an observable drop in its performance level and initial faults may 
occur during the degradation progress. The incipient defects continuously prolifer-
ates and the severity gradually increases which causes the system to fail to perform 
its required function and fails. In order to predict and prevent failures in advanced,"
175,"diagnostics and prognostics techniques are studied and employed to evaluate the 
current health conditions and forecast future performance.
Figure 3. Fault to failure progression
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
61
Figure 4 indicates the inputs and outputs of the machine diagnostics and prog-
nostics process. The diagnostics process determines how the system has degraded 
and investigates the cause or nature of such a degraded condition. Faults are de-"
176,"tected, isolated and identified to create a diagnostic record, and the faults possi-
bilities are computed to find the potential failure pattern. The diagnostic operations 
follow an analysing approach from effect to cause. On the other hand, prognostics 
considers time as a vital factor and focuses on predicting the future condition of the 
system or component and in calculating accurately the remaining useful life before"
177,"the failure. The prediction is conducted from cause to effect. The analysing and 
computing process is based on current system conditions and future operational 
requirements. Although similar information and knowledge bases are shared, the 
difference between the two concepts now becomes obvious. Diagnostics is to in-
vestigate and determine a failure mode within a system; while prognostics is to 
compute a rather accurate result of the remaining useful life before final failure."
178,"The following sections present a diagnostics and prognostics system in Big Data 
Analytics with a case example. The system flowchart is shown in Figure 5. Fault 
identification is one of the diagnostics modules. The classification of machine 
failure is critical to smoothen the production, as not all the failures require emer-
gency maintenance. The result from the diagnostic model is able to assist in the 
development of prognostics model. The reliability of the prediction could be increas-"
179,"ingly improved from a known machine failure.
Figure 4. Inputs and outputs with the diagnostic–prognostic process structure

62
The machine failure identification has been developed and incorporated with 
the current decision making grid (DMG) in MDSS for the case company. The DMG 
model works like a map which categorizes the machines according to a set of pre-"
180,"defined parameters/criterions. The criteria for this project are the downtime and the 
frequency of failures from the sensor data and historical record (Exton & Labib, 
Figure 5. Flowchart of the proposed MDSS for case company
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
63
2002). Other criteria, such as cost, availability of MRO and the bottleneck problem, 
can also be included by expanding it from merely a 2 dimensional analysis to a 3"
181,"or more dimensional analysis model. Higher dimensional models can produce a 
more comprehensive and accurate analysis. The DMG then proposes the different 
types of maintenance policies based on the state in the grid which then determine 
the appropriate maintenance actions for the MDSS. These maintenance policies 
subsequently lead to be the formation of the following strategies; Operate to failure 
(OTF), fixed time maintenance (FTM), skill level upgrade (SLU), condition based"
182,"monitoring (CBM) and design out machine/component (DOM), as shown in Figure 
6.
•	
Operate to Failure: There are too many low downtime and low downtime 
frequency components which made it impossible or too expensive for apply-
ing scheduled PdM maintenance. These components/machines are allowed to 
operate to failure as they are deemed as having minimal impact on the sys-
tem. Ideally, if operators of the machine are also maintenance technicians,"
183,"which agrees with the TPM policy, OTF ‘faults’ can be further reduced with-
out the need for reporting and waiting for the technician to bring the machine 
back to normal operating state. A CrM approach is suggested for OTF 
situation.
•	
Fixed Time Maintenance: PvM is also called Fixed Time Maintenance. A 
more flexible PvM can be chosen which is determined either by availability, 
machine not in use, or by the severity of the faults. Faults with higher down-"
184,"time and frequency faults are allowed to have shorter fixed time maintenance,

whereas faults with lower downtime and frequency can extend the duration of 
their fixed time maintenance.
•	
Skill Level Upgrade: This strategy falls on the high frequency and low 
downtime grid. Faults that fall under this strategy are faults caused by human"
185,"errors, such as the accidental pressing of the wrong switch/button. For this 
grid, the human factor oriented policy will be emphasized, either through the 
human/operator or through the machine. From the human perspective, op-
erators can undergo skill level upgrading so that they can ratify the problem 
personally without any assistance from a maintenance technician. Whereas 
from the machine side, human errors can be reduced by designing more hu-
man oriented machine systems.

Condition Based Monitoring: This strategy falls in the low frequency and 
high downtime grid. This matches RCM policy where studies and measure-
ment need to be done to determine the underlying reliability condition of the 
machines. Sensors are usually be applied to feed monitoring data for machine 
learning in a PdM approach.
•	
Design Out Machine/Component: This strategy falls on the high frequency"
187,"and high downtime grid. Machines/components that are prescribed in this 
grid region are usually unable to manage the current production level or are 
subjected to substantial wear and tear after prolonged usage. Either the need 
to upgrade to a better machine/components or a replacement of a new ma-
chine has to be undertaken.
FUZZY LOGIC FOR DIAGNOSTICS MACHINE FAILURE
Fuzzy logic is an approximate reasoning model to estimate the possible outcome"
188,"based on a set of rules. This method has been proven to be a prominent control 
system that have been implemented in different engineering application, hardware 
monitoring and conditional-based assessment. The process of Fuzzy Logic is a 
simple, rule-based by using IF-THEN statements that imitate the decision making of 
humans to classify the type of responsive performance by defining the intermediate 
possibilities. Uncertainty in maintenance management, such as non-linear, impre-"
189,"cise and incomplete knowledge representation can be resolved by the adoption of 
fuzzy logic. As a consequence, conclusions are derived with certainty factor from 
a predefined fuzzy sets.
The research focus of predictive maintenance is to discover and recognize critical 
random failure, involving low frequency and high downtime of maintenance. The 
guidance from diagnostics in MDSS presents satisfactory knowledge rules to suggest"
190,"maintenance action afterwards. Fuzzy Logic in KBS is merely a suitable algorithm 
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
65
for machine faliure identification in an imprecise enironment. The linkage between 
machine failure and classification of maintenance policies are frequently vague and 
subject to various sensory information. In practice, however, a need to refine the 
DGM model is required due to two scenarios. The first scenario is when data is"
191,"located close to each another but at different sides of the policy boundary, leading 
to applying different strategies, despite being closely similar with one another. The 
next scenario is when two data points are located at both ends of the boundary within 
the same grid, leading to applying the same strategies, despite being far apart, as 
shown in Figure 7. Therefore, the concept of Fuzzy Logic can be applied to reshape 
the rigid boundaries,and make it more logical for the system."
192,"A Fuzzy Logic design for semiconductor equipment is provided with two factors: 
downtime records and frequency records as in Figure 8. All membership functions 
(MF) are selected as trapezium shape, with two numerical inputs and one numerical 
output involved, as shown in Figure 9. Defuzzification is a method of extracting a 
crisp value from a fuzzy set as a representative value. In general there are five 
methods, for defuzzifying a fuzzy set A in a universe of discourse Z. These methods"
193,"are the Centroid of Area (COA) or Center of Gravity, Mean of Maximum (MOM), 
Bisector of Area (BOA), Smallest of Maximum (SOM) and Largest of Maximum 
(LOM). COA is selected as the defuzzification strategy for the model. A fuzzy if-
then rule is applied on the interface, as shown in Figure 10. When all rules and 
membership functions are settled, the Fuzzy Logic Rule Viewer and Fuzzy Logic 
Surface Viewer can be examined in Figure 11. With the help of fuzzy logic, the"

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR PROGNOSTICS 
MACHINE FAILURE
Prognostics is a model that is able to predict machine failure compared with normal 
behavior on a real time basis. Maintenance in advanced is better adopted to the 
necessity of repairs for an in-service machine in order to mitigate the disruption 
of the overall production. A health condition assessment is required to check the"
196,"machine status frequently. Machine failure can be caused by normal degradation 
and random failure. Basic KBS and DM are incapable of distinguishing random 
failure and normal degradation, since machine degradation follows time progres-
sion rather than by rules. Therefore, an adoptive approach of machine learning to 
prognosticate the next random failure is required. The Artificial Neural Network

(ANN) model is a supervised learning method to estimate the Remaining Useful 
Lifetime (RUL) of a machine from degraded failure, or to differentiate anomalies 
from normal machine behavior. ANN can be used as a time series or forecasting 
of unanticipated machine failure with online sensory data, which is able to learn"
198,"patterns from the training data set to distinguish the normal machine behavior and 
any anomalies. The prediction in machine failure involves Big Data management 
with the purpose of strengthening the data quality. Continuous data collection from 
different sensors installed in the machine supports the quality of prediction.
Figure 13 illustrates the mechanism of the ANN model. The basic ANN algo-
rithm estimates the feasible outputs for prediction maintenance from observation"
199,"data or sensory information in order to understand the machine condition. ANN 
provides assurance in resolving prediction and performance assessment with suffi-

cient continuous input data. Vibration, heat and temperature sensors are established 
for the evaluation of the semiconductor machine. ANN is a simple artificial neuron"
200,"processing system, which included input nodes, number of hidden layers, weighted 
factors of adjacent layers and output nodes. The hidden layers function as connectors 
between the input nodes and output nodes to transform and extract features of the 
input space. The prediction accuracy of ANN is dependent on the training process. 
The training process allows adjustment the synaptic weighting of input and develops"
201,"the overall network by the construction of hidden layer. Before the actual running 
of the prediction, correct data and wrong data must be available in the training of 
supervised learning algorithm to ascertain its reliability in prediction. As a rule of 
thumb, 60% of the dataset is needed for training and the remaining dataset is for 
running test. Big Databases are able to collect huge amounts of historical and online 
data to enhance the accuracy of an ANN model through trial and error."
202,"The predictive tasks in MDSS are presented in the following three main func-
tions:
•	
Health Condition Assessment: The main goal is to monitor the machine 
performance and machine components degradation. In MPM, considerable 
maintenance actions could be resolved by component replacement. The sen-
sor network can effectively enhance MRO order processing and improve flex-
ibility in maintenance scheduling for the component substitution. The ma-"
203,"chine downtime caused by component damage could be reduced to meet the 
aim of agile production recovery.
•	
Anomalies Detection Assessment: Anomalies detection is an approach in 
root cause analysis. Machine anomalies may take place when the machine 
are not working normally. The cause of consistency anomalies is not straight-

forward to detect. ML algorithms are capable of measuring the machine per-
formance from the current and normal conditions for identifying anomalies. 
The features of abnormality in machine performance are provided for further 
inspection by the repair technicians.
•	
Remaining Useful Lifetime Assessment: The major challenge in asset man-
agement is to optimize the machine lifetime utilization. Different machine 
usage may conclude variability of depreciation. In addition, longer lead time"
205,"in machine replacement causes an uncertainty in the production and supply 
chain performance. The estimation of remaining useful lifetime by sensory 
information can effectively leverage the machine lifetime utilization and pre-
diction for the machine replacement and performing a just-in-time machine 
replacement policy.
•	
Scheduling Optimization for Maintenance in Advance: Prediction of fore-
seeable machine failure is used to assess the machine expected performance"
206,"in the future and optimize the maintenance schedules with less adverse ef-
fect on production disruption. Unanticipated machine failure may give a lon-
ger downtime and cease the manufacturing process. The prediction from the 
ANN model emphasizes proactive maintenance and provides the right time 
to conduct inspection. ANN captures the possible reasons, like the timeline 
of the machine failure event, reasons, duration and relevance information of"
207,"the machines by triggered sensory information. With systematic maintenance 
in advanced, unplanned machine stopping can be eliminated.
MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The entire Big Data framework requires human intelligence and expert opinion in 
the design stage. It is difficult for the manufacturer to manage and, control big data 
and select relevant information for MDSS. The availability of sensors and techno-"
208,"logical advancement enable explorative research of Big Data Analytics, and allows 
organizations to expand their capability to enhance the data transparency of machine 
status for manufacturers. The speedy data flow and collection of abundant data 
through WSNs enhance the potential of analytical performance. The adoption of Big 
Data in MDSS state a significant step in machine health condition diagnosis. The 
proposed approach helps to mitigate machine failure during production and uncover"
209,"the hidden patterns through Big Data Analytics. However, management faces three 
major challenges of transformation traditional maintenance to advanced MDSS.
Various industries noticed that the size of data has been exponentially increasing 
and accelerating due to the comprehensive use of sensor network. The transition from 
conventional database to non-relational database is not only upgrading the storage 
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
71"
210,"71
capacity, but also requiring an infrastructure and expertise to process, and handle 
structured and unstructured data. Handling and understanding on the petabytes or 
even exabyte of data has become a challenge for IT teams. More advanced capabil-
ity in data warehouses and network connection expedites real time data processing.
Due to the complexity of data type, the current processing techniques could not 
meet the demand of Big Data Infrastructure. Due to the enormous data booming via"
211,"WSNs, a cohesive platform for processing structure and unstructured data becomes 
an essential element for any enterprises. The major purpose of Big Data Infrastruc-
ture is to resolve the problem of incompatible data formats and non-aligned data 
structures. The impact on inconsistency of unstructured data requires pre-processing 
of data input to enhance the performance of Big Data Mining.
Investigating the unstructured data in manufacturing not only create the value"
212,"for the production engineer but also support MDSS with more vigorous and so-
phisticated Big Data Analytics. Several research paper mentioned that analyzing the 
unstructured data is the first priority in decision-making and prediction (Li, Bagheri, 
Goote, Hasan, & Hazard, 2013; Muhtaroglu, Demir, Obali, & Girgin, 2013; Wielki, 
2013). However, not all the unstructured data can be beneficial to knowledge de-
velopment and decision-making process. The relevant machine data must be fit for"
213,"purpose of maintenance policy selection. Proper domain experts in place are critical 
to interpret the sensory information for predictive maintenance during the design 
stage of Big Data Analytics. Furthermore, enhancing data quality by the adoption 
of suitable sensors in the machine is also an importance for the company. Big Data 
offers tremendous insight to the diagnostics and prognostics of the machine status."
214,"Nonetheless, the information reliability from predictive maintenance is only avail-
able with appropriate sensors selection and adoption. In today’s Big Data Analytics, 
research focus has been shifted from Volume of data to quality data.
Regarding the complexity of Big Data Analytics in MDSS, collaboration of in-
dustrial expertise and scholars must be involved to have sufficient breadth and depth 
of domain knowledge to design an appropriate Big Data Analytics for maintenance"
215,"strategies. The proactive approach to predict machine failure provides a high level 
reliability for excellence in maintenance management. Further benefit can be sum-
marized as reducing the frequency of corrective maintenance, increasing machine 
performance and enhancing overall production reliability.
FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Future research is oriented to the utilization of manufacturing information in the 
Cyber Physical System (CPS). Big Data Analytics are able to achieve better trans-"
216,"parency of production, which provides knowledge insight to practitioners. With the 
Big Data Analytics for Predictive Maintenance Strategies
72
technological advancement in Internet of Things and the utilization of sophisticated 
prediction tools, specialized automotive networks in a manufacturing company could 
be developed for real time monitoring and control at the strategical level. Incorporat-
ing the manufacturing computational intelligence into the machine health monitoring"
217,"allow the manufacturers to enhance the overall system reliability and production 
efficiency, especially in reducing the machine downtime. Predictive maintenance 
is not only about health assessment but also detect the abnormality of the machine 
before it breaks down. To have a step forward from predictive maintenance, pro-
duction plant should realize the importance of just-in-time maintenance strategy 
for the whole production process. Implementation of CPS synthesizes data from"
218,"WSNs to enable the remaining life prediction so as to improve the asset utilization. 
Risk assessment and impact evaluation of machine failure will also allow produc-
tion engineers to estimate the production system reliability. This motive turns the 
predictive manufacturing system into a “self-aware-and-self-adjustment” system, 
with intelligent machines and sensors in Big Data era.
CONCLUSION
In this book chapter, the predictive maintenance model and Big Data Analytics in"
219,"managerial aspects are presented. The feature extraction through Big Data Analyt-
ics can be beneficial to managing the machine condition and in predicting machine 
failure. The MDSS in Big Data is able to suggest maintenance strategies and provide 
insight for management to tackle maintenance issues. The proactive strategies in 
maintenance can be achieved by embedded sensors and real time based machine 
monitoring systems. Besides, the prediction from Big Data Analytics and suggested"
220,"analytics processes are well-designed to reduce the maintenance turnaround time 
and substantially enhance the production system availability. MRO and maintenance 
resources can be planned in advanced to facilitate the process during the machine 
downtime. Moreover, it provides flexibility to design maintenance schedules to 
mitigate the risk of unplanned stoppings. The overall maintenance efficiency can 
be much improved by the implementation of predictive maintenance under a Big"
221,"Data platform.

Abstract—This paper presents a sensory-updated degradation-
based predictive maintenance policy (herein referred to as the
SUDM policy). The proposed maintenance policy utilizes con-
temporary degradation models that combine component-speciﬁc
real-time degradation signals, acquired during operation, with
degradation and reliability characteristics of the component’s
population to predict and update the residual life distribution"
232,"(RLD). By capturing the latest degradation state of the component
being monitored, the updating process provides a more accurate
of the remaining life. With the aid of a stopping rule, maintenance
routines are scheduled based on the most recently updated RLD.
The performance of the proposed maintenance policy is evaluated
using a simulation model of a simple manufacturing cell. Fre-
quency of unexpected failures and overall maintenance costs are"
233,"computed and compared with two other benchmark maintenance
policies: a reliability-based and a conventional degradation-based
maintenance policy (without any sensor-based updating).

HE ADVENT of sensor technology has brought about
an increased interest in prognostic health management"
234,"and its impact on maintenance management. The development
of optimal maintenance strategies is necessary for improving
system reliability, preventing the occurrence of unexpected
system failures, and reducing maintenance costs [1]–[3]. This
is particularly true in just-in-time manufacturing environments
where unexpected machine breakdowns can be prohibitively
expensive because they result in immediate lost production,
failed shipping schedules, and poor customer satisfaction."
235,"Preventive maintenance (PM), one of the most popular main-
tenance policies, involves periodic inspections necessary for
maintaining equipment upkeep as well as performing correc-
tive actions. Identifying the appropriate PM interval requires
analyzing failure time data and is determined solely based on
age or service time [3]. Thus, PM does not take into account
the condition or degradation characteristics of a system while"

planning maintenance activities. This can sometimes lead to un-
necessary maintenance routines and loss in production capacity.
In contrast, condition-based maintenance (CBM) utilizes real-
time condition monitoring (CM) information to schedule main-
tenance routines. CM involves observing degradation-based"
238,"measures, such as temperature, vibration, acoustic emissions,
from an operating system or device to determine its state of
health [4]–[7].
Sensory information collected by CM techniques often ex-
hibits characteristic patterns known as degradation signals.
Degradation signals can be used to predict a system’s remaining
lifetime [8]. It is not unusual for degradation signals of iden-
tical components to have similar evolutionary paths that can"
239,"be modeled using some functional form, for example, linear,
exponential, etc. [9]. Gebraeel et al. [10], [11] presented base
case sensor-based degradation models for estimating residual
life distributions (RLDs) of partially degraded components.
These distributions were continuously updated using in situ
degradation signals in a Bayesian manner. The authors tested
the predictability of their methodology using vibration-based
degradation signals observed from an experimental rotating"
240,"machinery setup.
This paper builds on the recently developed sensor-
based degradation models and presents a sensory-updated
degradation-based maintenance (SUDM) policy. Unlike con-
ventional CBM which uses CM from a system or component
being monitored, the SUDM policy combines population-based
degradation characteristics with real-time monitoring informa-
tion to predict the remaining lifetime. First, a general degrada-
tion model is used to estimate the RLD of a partially degraded"
241,"system. The preliminary RLD is used to develop an initial
maintenance schedule. The RLDs are then updated in real-
time using in situ degradation signals. The schedule of the
corresponding maintenance actions is, in turn, revised based on
the most recently updated residual lifetime estimates.
It is important to note that sensory-updated degradation mod-
els have not been considered in the context of a maintenance
framework. Furthermore, it is not clear how these models will"
242,"perform in such a framework. Consequently, this paper studies
some of the challenges associated with using these updated
models to develop an adaptive maintenance policy. Some of the
key challenges include the following:
1) First, the sensory-updating procedure is performed con-
tinuously over time. Thus, it is necessary to establish a
stopping rule at which point the most recently updated
RLD is used to estimate the residual lifetime and schedule
maintenance.

2) Second, there is a possibility that the sensory-updated
degradation models will provide relatively conservative
residual life estimates depending on when the updating
process will be terminated. For example, in an experi-
mental study discussed in Section III, a base case model
tested on a rotating machinery application provided sig-"
244,"niﬁcantly conservative residual life estimates, particularly
at the earlier stages of the degradation process. These
predictions slowly improved over time until they were
within ±2% of the actual failure times during later stages
of degradation (see Fig. 2 in Section III-B). Therefore,
there is a warranted concern that a maintenance policy
that utilizes sensory-updated degradation models may be
too conservative depending on the effect of the updating"
245,"stopping rule mentioned earlier. Such a scenario may
result in a high number of preventive replacements, thus,
increasing maintenance costs and reducing throughput
due to an increased frequency of planned shutdowns.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II reviews some of the relevant literature. Section III
describes the degradation modeling approach that will be used
to developed our maintenance policy. Section IV discusses"
246,"our Sensory-Updated Degradation-Based Maintenance Policy
(SUDM policy). In Section V, we develop an ARENA simula-
tion model to evaluate the performance of the proposed policy
by comparing it to two benchmark policies, a reliability-based
PM policy and a condition-based predictive maintenance policy
that utilizes degradation models developed by Lu and Meeker
[9]. Simulation Results are discussed in Section VI. Finally,
Section VII discusses the conclusions and some future research
directions."

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Condition-based maintenance focuses scheduling mainte-
nance activities by periodically or continuously monitoring
speciﬁc measures that are related to the health and performance
of the systems that are being maintained. Once these measures
exceed a predeﬁned failure threshold, the system is shutdown
for repair. For example, in Nakagawa and Ito [12] present
condition-based PM policies for critical components of fossil-"
248,"ﬁred power plants. They consider the plant as a system that
fails once the cumulative damage of its components exceeds
a predetermined managerial damage level. In [6] Sloan and
Shanthikumar, assumed that the condition of equipment is mon-
itored at equidistant time intervals. The authors also assumed
that equipment can fail within an inspection interval, and the
probability of failure is exponential. Marseguerra et al. [7]
assumed continuously monitored multicomponent system and"
249,"use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for determining the optimal
degradation level beyond which PM has to be performed. In
[13], Wu et al. developed an integrated neural-network-based
decision support system for predictive maintenance of rota-
tional equipment. The integrated system focused on minimizing
expected cost per unit operational time, and consisted of a
heuristic managerial decision rule for different scenarios of
predictive and corrective cost compositions."
250,"predictive and corrective cost compositions.
A signiﬁcant portion of CBM research is based on Propor-
tional hazard models. Proportional hazard models consist of a
benchmark hazard function and explanatory variables to char-
acterize a system’s hazard function based on external operating
conditions [14]–[20]. They have also been used in various engi-
neering applications, such as aircrafts, marine applications, and
machinery [14]–[16]. They have also been used to determine"
251,"the optimal replacement policies [21] and maintenance intervals
[17], [18].
Unlike proportional hazard models, degradation models fo-
cus on modeling the evolution of condition-based sensor signals
(aka degradation signals) obtained from partially degraded sys-
tems. Lu and Meeker [9] developed a two-stage methodology
to model the path of a condition-based degradation signal
using random coefﬁcients growth models. Their models utilize
a sample of degradation signals to estimate the RLDs for a"
252,"population of components. Other studies used Brownian motion
to model degradation processes examples include work done
by Doksum and Hoyland [22], Whitmore [23] and Whitmore
and Schenkelberg [24]. However, most of these degradation
modeling approaches rarely integrate real-time degradation
signals with the goal of updating the estimation of the re-
maining lifetime of components still operating in the ﬁeld.
Gebraeel et al. [10], [11] developed a sensor-based updating"
253,"method for updating remaining life distributions of systems
and their components while they operate in the ﬁeld. The
maintenance policy proposed in this paper is based on the
degradation modeling framework proposed in [10] and [11].
The sensory-updating procedure is used to establish a linkage
between maintenance scheduling and the degradation states of
machines or equipment being maintained.
Maintenance policies have a signiﬁcant impact on the per-"
254,"formance of a manufacturing facility. For example, Sloan and
Shanthikumar [6] developed a Markov decision process model
that simultaneously determines maintenance and production
schedules for a multiple-product, single-machine production
systems. In this model, equipment condition was explicitly
linked to yield loss. Several research efforts have worked on
extending classic economic manufacturing quantity models
to account for changing equipment condition and inspection"
255,"policies [25]–[28]. For example in [28], the authors propose
GA-based optimization procedure for scheduling of mainte-
nance operations in a manufacturing system by considering
production gains and maintenance expenses. The authors used
discrete even simulation to evaluate the performance of their
policy.
Simulation has been widely used to study the effectiveness
of maintenance management systems [29]. Jianhui et al. [30]
developed an integrated prognostic process based on data"
256,"collected from model-based simulations under nominal and
degraded conditions. Wang et al. [31] developed a condition-
based replacement and spare provisioning policy for deteri-
orating systems with uncertain deterioration to failure. They
developed a simulation model to characterize the opera-
tion for the system operation under the proposed condition-
based methodology and use a genetic algorithm to jointly
optimize replacement, inspection, and inventory decision
variables.

Some research works considered the interaction between
maintenance policies and manufacturing systems. Logendran
and Talkington [32] used simulation modeling to compare
the performance of cellular and functional work cell layouts
while considering two different maintenance policies: a cor-
rective and a PM policy. Vineyard and Meredith [33] used"
258,"simulation to analyze the effect of ﬁve different maintenance
policies on ﬂexible manufacturing systems (FMS) subject to
random failure. Variations of corrective, preventive, and op-
portunistic maintenance policies were investigated. The authors
demonstrated that the choice of a maintenance policy affected
the number of maintenance tasks required, and that a hybrid
maintenance policy, combining reactionary, time, and event-
triggered preventive characteristics, resulted in the least num-"
259,"ber of maintenance tasks and system downtime. Savsar [34]
also analyzed the performance of an FMS considering cor-
rective, preventive, and opportunistic maintenance policies.
Rezg et al. [35] used simulation to present a joint optimal
inventory control and PM strategy for a randomly failing pro-
duction units operating under a just-in-time conﬁguration. A
cost function was used to evaluate optimal PM interval time
and buffer stock level for the system.
III. SENSORY-UPDATED DEGRADATION MODELING"
260,"III. SENSORY-UPDATED DEGRADATION MODELING
The sensory-updated degradation modeling framework rests
on the idea that the functional form of a degradation signal is
correlated with the underlying physical phenomena that occur
during a degradation process. The functional form is mod-
eled as a continuous-time continuous-state stochastic model.
In general, the magnitude of the degradation signal of the ith
component at time tj is given as
S(tij) = η(tij; Φim, Ξik, Bil) + ε(tij)
(1)"
261,"S(tij) = η(tij; Φim, Ξik, Bil) + ε(tij)
(1)
where η(·) represents the functional form that describes the path
followed by the degradation signal. Φm is a vector of m deter-
ministic parameters that represent constant degradation features
common to all units of the population. Ξik = (θi1, . . . , θik) is
a vector of k stochastic parameters used to model the unit-to-
unit variability, such as degradation rates, across the popula-
tion. The stochastic parameters are assumed to follow speciﬁc"
262,"distributions across the population of components with those
of the individual components being an unknown “draw” from
the distribution. Bil = (βi1, . . . , βil) is a vector of l covariates
(ﬁxed and/or stochastic) that capture external factors, such as
time-varying operating and environmental conditions. ε(tij) are
error terms that capture environmental noise and other signal
transients.
Databases of historical reliability and condition-based degra-"
263,"dation measures are used to estimate: 1) the values of the
deterministic model parameters and ﬁxed covariates and 2) the
prior distributions of stochastic model parameters and stochas-
tic covariates. The resulting model is a generalized degradation
model (similar to that proposed by Lu and Meeker [9]). This
preliminary model can be used to compute the RLD of a
population of components. Evaluating the RLD is equivalent to
computing the distribution of the time needed for the magnitude"
264,"of the degradation signal to reach/cross a predetermined failure
threshold η∗and can be expressed as follows:
P{T ≤t|Φm, Ξik, Bil}
=P{η(tij; Φm, Ξik, Bil) + ε(tij) ≥η∗|Φm, Ξik, Bil} .
(2)
Real-time degradation signals are used to revise the general-
ized degradation model based on the unique degradation char-
acteristics of each device or component being monitored. This
is achieved by updating the prior distributions of the stochastic
parameters and covariates. The sensory-updating procedure is"
265,"based on a Bayesian approach. It combines two sources of
information: 1) the prior distribution of the parameters across
the population of components and 2) the real-time degradation
signals unique to the individual component. Consequently, the
resulting degradation model represents a more precise estimate
of the true trajectory of the component’s degradation signal
and can be used to update the distribution of the residual
life of the component being monitored. In the following sec-"
266,"tion, we review the exponential base case as proposed by
Gebraeel et al. [10].
A. Base Case Sensory-Updated Exponential Degradation
Model: A Review
The exponential base case is suitable for systems and compo-
nents where preliminary and partial degradation accelerates the
degradation process of a system. In this base case, we consider
the special case where the error term follows a Brownian
motion [10]. Under these assumptions, the amplitude of the"
267,"observed degradation signal S(t) is deﬁned as follows:
S(t) = θeβteε(t)−σ2t
2
(3)
where θ is a random variable that follows a Lognormal distri-
bution, i.e., ln θ is Normal with mean μo and variance σ2
o, and
β is Normal with mean μ1 and variance σ2
1. The parameters θ
and β are assumed to be independent. The error term ε(t) =
σW(t) is a Brownian motion with mean zero and variance
σ2t. For mathematical convenience, we work with the logged
degradation signal. Thus, we deﬁne L(t) as follows:"
268,"L(t) = θ′ + β′t + ε(t)
(4)
where θ′ = ln θ and β′ = β −(σ2/2).
Li is assumed deﬁned as the increment between two con-
secutive signals, i.e., Li = L(ti) −L(ti−1), the difference be-
tween the observed value of the logged signal at times ti and
ti−1, for i = 2, 3, . . ., with L1 = L(t1). π1(θ′) and π2(β′) are
deﬁned as the prior distributions of θ′ and β′, respectively.
Note that π1(θ′) is Normal with mean μ0 and variance σ2
0, and
π2(β′) is a Normal distribution with mean μ′
1 = μ1 −(σ2/2)"
269,"1 = μ1 −(σ2/2)
and variance σ2
1. The parameters of the prior distributions are
estimated from a sample of degradation signals. The model
requires that ε(0) = 0, and thus L(0) = θ′. The distribution of
θ′ is estimated from the sample of signal intercepts. Due to
the Brownian motion assumption, the error terms increments
are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.), and the random

variables Xk (6) are i.i.d. with mean β′. Thus, X is used to
estimate the value of β′ for an individual degradation signal
Xk = L(tk) −L(tk−1)
tk −tk−1
,
k = 1, 2, . . . .
(5)
Given the observed signal values, L1, . . . , Lk, observed at
times t1, . . . , tk, the updated distributions of θ′ and β′ can be
estimated using Bayes theorem
P(θ′, β′|L1, . . . , Lk) ∝f(L1, . . . , Lk|θ′, β′)π1(θ′)π2(β′).

As previously mentioned, this model was developed in [10]."

Next, we use the updated distributions of the stochastic
parameters to compute the predictive distribution of the signal
L(tk + t) which is Normal with the following mean and vari-
ance [10]:
˜μ(t + tk) = L(tk) + μβ′t
(7)
˜σ2(t + tk) = σ2
β′t2 + σ2t.
(8)
Using the predictive distribution of the degradation signal,
we calculate the updated RLD of the component that is being
monitored as the distribution of the time until the degradation"
273,"signal reaches a predetermined failure threshold D.
Let T be a random variable that denote the residual life
of the partially degraded component. Therefore, T satisﬁes
L(tk + t) = D, and its distribution is given by
FT (t) = P(T ≤t|L1, . . . , Lk) = Φ
 ˜μ(t + tk) −ln(D)
˜σ(t + tk)

where Φ(.) is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a
standardized Normal random variable.

274,"of the sensor-based degradation modeling approach with the aid

B. Prediction Results
Twenty-ﬁve rolling element bearings were run to failure,
and their degradation signals observed over time. A sample
of the degradation signals is shown in Fig. 1. Remaining life
distributions are computed and updated continuously as the
degradation signals are observed.

i, and ˆti
k is the Median of the RLD of Bk computed at the ith
sampling epoch. Note that the Median was chosen because the
ﬁrst and second moments of the RLD could not be evaluated.
Fig. 2 shows the prediction results of a base case sensory-
updated exponential degradation model. The x-axis represents
degradation percentiles at which RLDs were computed or up-
dated. In other words, the 90th degradation percentile means"
277,"that the component has accomplished 90% of its service life.
Note that these percentiles are evaluated after actual failure
times have been observed.
IV. SUDM POLICY
For a given system of partially degraded equipment, imple-
menting the SUDM policy consists of the steps shown in Fig. 3.
The ﬁrst step involves deﬁning degradation models that will be
used to characterize the evolution of the degradation signals

associated with the equipment that are being monitored. This
requires identifying the functional forms of the degradation
models, i.e., linear, exponential, etc. Next, a database of degra-
dation signals is used to estimate the parameters of the degrada-
tion models. The result is set of generalized degradation models"
279,"for each type of component, which can be used to estimate
initial RLDs, FT (t). These preliminary distributions are used
to compute expected remaining lifetimes E[RLD], which will
be used to develop preliminary maintenance schedule. As noted
by Gebraeel et al. [10], it is not possible to compute the mean
of the RLD. Consequently, we use the median as our estimate
of the residual life, Q0.5[RLD], where Q0.5 represents the
50th quantile. Hence, the initial maintenance schedule is evalu-"
280,"ated based on the predicted remaining lifetimes, Q0.5[RLD].
This schedule is then revised using the sensory updating
methodology.
The SUDM policy uses in situ degradation signals acquired
using CM techniques to continuously update the RLDs, in
real-time. The updated predictions are then used to revise the
initial maintenance schedule. Thus, the maintenance schedule is
continuously modiﬁed as real-time degradation signals become
available. The updating process continues until a pre-speciﬁed"
281,"stopping rule is satisﬁed.
A. Sensory-Updating Stopping Rule
In the context of the sensory-updating procedure, the optimal
stopping decision involves a tradeoff between continuing to up-
date the RLDs and, in turn, revising the maintenance schedule
versus stopping the acquisition of sensory-based signals and
executing the most recently updated maintenance schedule. The
beneﬁt of continuing the sensory-updating is that the resulting
RLDs capture the most recent degradation state of the system"
282,"being monitored, thus providing higher prediction accuracy.
This fact was demonstrated by the plot f the prediction errors
in Fig. 2. In order to ﬁnalize the maintenance schedule and
plan the allocation of maintenance resources, it is necessary to
stop the sensory-updating process and execute the most recent
schedule. Stopping becomes even more important if we con-
sider the costs of acquiring sensory data. In some applications,
these costs can be relatively expensive."
283,"these costs can be relatively expensive.
This paper takes a basic approach in developing the stopping
rule and serves as a preliminary step for future research. Our
stopping rule is given by the following expression:
min
0<tk<∞{1 −[FT (tk+δ) −FT (tk)]} ≥R
(11)
where R is the desired reliability level, FT (tk) is the cdf
of the remaining life updated at time tk, tk is the time or
epoch at which the last degradation signal was observed, and"
284,"δ represents a small time increment in the future (used for
calculating the cdf).
Equation (11) states that given a desired reliability level R,
we continuously update the RLD of an operating component
until the ﬁrst updating time epoch tk, where the component’s
instantaneous reliability exceeds the desired reliability R. Once
the stopping rule has been satisﬁed, the corresponding RLD is
used to schedule maintenance for the component or equipment
being monitored."
285,"being monitored.
V. SIMULATION MODEL OF THE SUDM POLICY
This simulation model studies the effect of the proposed
maintenance policy on the performance of a simple manufac-
turing workcell consisting of ﬁve parallel single-stage manu-
facturing workstations (see Fig. 4). Preprocessed parts arrive
to a staging station. The interarrival time is assumed to be
exponential with a mean 0.25 min. Upon arrival, each part is
processed on the ﬁrst available workstation. The processing"
286,"times of each workstation is assumed to follow a triangular
distribution (0.6, 0.8, 1). Upon completion, the ﬁnished part is
transferred to a shipping area.
An operational workstation can become unavailable for two
possible reasons: a random failure occurs or a scheduled main-
tenance routine is performed. Workstation failures follow a
Weibull failure time distribution. Speciﬁcally, a workstation’s
downtime is assumed to be random and follows a Normal distri-"
287,"bution with mean 5 min and variance 0.5 min. Furthermore, we
assume that each workstation degrades gradually until it fails.
A database of a bearing-application failure times and degra-
dation signals is used to provide real-world degradation data.
The degradation database is developed from a series of acceler-
ated degradation tests in which vibration signals associated with
the degradation of rolling element bearings are continuously"
288,"acquired during run-to-failure tests. The degradation database
contains vibration-based degradation signals of 50 bearings as
KAISER AND GEBRAEEL: PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT

Schematic of the manufacturing workcell.
well as their associated failure times. This is the same database
used by Gebraeel et al. [10], [11]. The failure times will be
used to estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution. On
the other hand, the vibration-based degradation signals will be"
289,"used to simulate the degradation of the workstations. This does
not imply that a bearing is the only component degrading in
the workstation. This simply suggests that we are using real-
world degradation signals to represent the degradation process
of a workstation as a single degrading entity, as opposed to,
simulating degradation signals and using them to represent
workstation degradation within our simulation model.
Before we perform our simulation study, we will ﬁrst divide"
290,"our bearing degradation database into two sets. The ﬁrst set,
deﬁned as the “prior set,” will be used to estimate the param-
eters of the degradation model and the Weibull failure time
distribution. The second set, deﬁned as “validation set,” will
be used to evaluate the performance of our maintenance policy.
A. Estimation of Prior Parameters
Failure times of the ﬁrst 25 bearings (bearings 1 to 25) were
used to estimate the scale and shape parameters of the Weibull"
291,"distribution, θW = 3.0549 and βW = 784.75 (subscript “W” is
used to distinguish the parameters of the Weibull distribution
from the stochastic parameters of the degradation models).
The corresponding 25 degradation signals (bearings 1 to 25)
are used to estimate the prior distributions of the stochastic
parameters of the exponential degradation model. The prior
distribution of θ; π1(θ) ∼N(−6.031, 0.346). As previously
mentioned, to estimate β′, we use X which is expressed by"
292,"equation (6). Twenty-ﬁve estimates of β′ are used to derive
its prior distribution as follows: π2(β′) ∼N(0.0081, 1.035 ×
10−5). The error terms are assumed to have independent and
normally distributed increments (Brownian motion assump-
tion). That is ε(t1), ε(t2) −ε(t1), . . . , ε(tk) −ε(tk−1) are as-
sumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean
zero and variance σ2(tk+1 −tk).
At the beginning of the simulation, preliminary RLDs for"
293,"each workstation are computed using the prior information.
During the simulation, degradation signals from the validation
set (from bearings 26 to 50) are used to represent the degra-
dation of each workstation. As the signals are observed, they
are used to update the RLD of corresponding workstation. The
updating process continues until the stopping rule in (10) is sat-
isﬁed. Note that in our simulation model the desired reliability"
294,"level R refers to the reliability of an individual workstation. The
updated RLD is used to revise the maintenance schedule.
Our simulation model consists of two submodels. The ﬁrst
is called the Manufacturing submodel and is used to simulate
the operational characteristics of the manufacturing workcell.
The second submodel characterizes the control logic of the
maintenance policy and is referred to as the Maintenance Policy
submodel.
B. Manufacturing Workcell Submodel"
295,"submodel.
B. Manufacturing Workcell Submodel
The manufacturing submodel is used to simulate part arrival,
processing, and departure. Parts arrive to the system randomly
at a predetermined rate and are held in a queue until one of
ﬁve workstations becomes available. If all the workstations are
occupied, i.e., already processing parts, the part waits in queue
until a workstation becomes available. Once a workstation is
available, the ﬁrst part in the queue is processed according to"
296,"a prespeciﬁed processing time. The processing time of each
workstation is assumed to follow a Triangular distribution with
the following parameters 0.6, 0.8, and 1 time units. Once
processing is complete, the part exits the system.
C. Maintenance Policy Submodel
This submodel simulates workstation failures and planned re-
placements. This is performed using two subroutines. The ﬁrst
is responsible for generating workstation failure times while"
297,"the second is responsible for shutting down the workstation.
The two subroutines work in tandem to simulate failure and
maintenance for each workstation.
1) Failure Time Subroutine: We assume that each worksta-
tion undergoes graceful degradation, and its degradation signal
is simulated using a real-world vibration-based degradation
signal (similar to the ones used in [11]). During simulation, the
degradation signal of workstation i is used to update its RLD"
298,"using (9). Once the stopping rule is satisﬁed, we compute a
planned maintenance interval for the ith workstation, mainte-
nance_interval_i, which is given by the following expression:
maintenance_interval_i = Q0.5
	
RLDk
i"
299,"(12)
where RLDk
i is the RLD of workstation i evaluated at the
time tk.
A workstation experiences an unexpected failure if its degra-
dation signal reaches a failure threshold, i.e.,
tk + Q0.5
	
RLDk
i"
300,"> failure_time_i.
(13)
The term tk + Q0.5[RLDk
i ] represents the predicted failure
time. failure_time_i is the actual failure time of the ith work-
station. The values of the variable failure_time are generated
846
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS—PART A: SYSTEMS AND HUMANS, VOL. 39, NO. 4, JULY 2009
from a distribution (assumed to be Weibull) given that the
workstation has survived up to tk.
2) Resource Shutdown Subroutine: The resource shutdown"
301,"subroutine is responsible for identifying the type of shutdown
that occurs, i.e., unexpected failure or planned maintenance/
replacement. There are two cases described below.
1) If (tk + Q0.5[RLDk
i ]) > failure_time_i, the shutdown
is for a planned maintenance routine. Once maintenance
is complete, the workstation is assumed to be “as good as
new.” A variable Nm is used to track the total number of
planned replacements.
2) If (tk + Q0.5[RLDk
i ]) < failure_time_i, the shutdown"
302,"i ]) < failure_time_i, the shutdown
is due to an unexpected failure. A variable Nf is used
to track the total number of failure replacements. Unex-
pected failures occur only if the workstation’s degrada-
tion signal reaches or exceeds a failure threshold before a
planned maintenance is scheduled.
D. Benchmark Policies
We compare the performance of our proposed maintenance
policy with two benchmark maintenance policies: a conven-
tional reliability-based PM policy and a degradation-based"
303,"maintenance (DM) policy that uses a similar exponential degra-
dation model but without the updating procedure (similar to Lu
and Meeker [9]).
1) PM Policy: The reliability-based PM policy uses a failure
time distribution to calculate the planned PM interval. For the
purpose of this analysis, we assume that the failure time of
the workstations follows the same failure distribution obtained
using failure times of the 25 bearings discussed earlier. We are"
304,"interested in evaluating the maintenance interval tR. To do this,
we solve for tR in the following expression:
F(tR) = (1 −R) = 1 −e−(tR/θW)βW
(14)
where F(tR) is the cdf of a Weibull distribution, θW is the
scale parameter and βW is the shape parameter of the Weibull
distribution, and R is the desired reliability level of the system.
We would like to emphasize that the PM policy is a time-
based policy. Thus, it does not consider the condition or degra-"
305,"dation state of the equipment being maintained.
2) DM Policy: The second benchmark maintenance policy
is based on the degradation modeling framework developed by
Lu and Meeker in [9]. This policy differs from the SUDM in
that there is no updating of the RLDs. Similar to the SUDM
policy, we focus on the exponential degradation model
S(t) = θeβt
(15)
where θ and β are random variables whose distribution follows
the prior distribution evaluated earlier for the degradation mod-"
306,"els used in the SUDM policy.
Once again for mathematical convenience, we work with the
log of the degradation signal
L(t) = ln (S(t)) = ln(θ) + βt
(16)
where ln θ ∼N(μ0, σ2
0) and β ∼N(μ1, σ2
1).
Fig. 5.
Frequency of failures for R = 70%.
Fig. 6.
Frequency of failures for R = 90%.
The RLD is equivalent to the distribution of the time it takes
a partial degradation signal to reach a predetermined failure
threshold, D. For this degradation model, the cdf residual of"
307,"the residual life is expressed as follows:
FT (tR) = P(T ≤tR) = Φ

tR −[ln(D) −μ0] /μ1

[σ2
0 + σ2
1t2
R] /μ2
1

.
(17)
Given a desired reliability level R = 1 −FT (tR), we solve
the above expression and ﬁnd the corresponding planned main-
tenance interval, tR. This policy is different from the PM policy
in that planned maintenance routines are based on condition-
based information. However, it does not account for the recent
state of health of the workstation that is being monitored."
308,"In the next section, we evaluate the performance of the
proposed policy by observing the number of failures, planned
replacements, and total maintenance costs. The results are com-
pared with those of the two benchmark maintenance policies.
VI. IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
Arena simulation is used to simulate the continuous opera-
tion of the manufacturing workcell. The simulation consists of
several runs. Each run is 365 days, and each day is assumed"
309,"to be two 8-h shifts. Separate runs were performed for each
maintenance policy.
Figs. 5 and 6 show frequency plots of the number of failures
associated with each maintenance policy at two levels of target
reliability, R = 70% and R = 90%. It is clear that the SUDM
maintenance policy results in a signiﬁcantly lower number of
unexpected workstation failures at both levels of reliability.

number of preventive workstation replacements at the 70% and

the number of failure replacements and planned replacements,
respectively, at 70% and 90% reliability levels. We observe that
the SUDM policy has the lowest mean and standard deviation
for the number of failure replacements (Table I). Our policy has"
312,"a higher number of planned replacements (Table II).

Total costs of maintenance policies assuming Cf/Cm = 2/1.
We also analyze the total maintenance costs TC of each
policy, i.e., costs of planned replacement plus costs of failure
replacements
TC = NfCf + NmCm
(18)
where Nf is the number of failure replacements, Cf is the"
313,"cost of performing a failure replacement, Nm is the number
of workstation planned replacements, and Cm is the cost of
performing a planned replacement.
The analysis was performed for three different Cf/Cm ratios;
“15/1,” “5/1,” and “2/1.” Figs. 9–11 show the total maintenance
costs for each maintenance policy as a function of different
reliability levels. For each ratio, Cf is assumed to be $750. The
SUDM policy has the lowest total maintenance cost across all
three cost ratios.

It is clear from Fig. 9 that the total costs associated with
the PM and the DM policies tend to decrease as the reliability
level increases. This observation is expected. Higher target
reliability levels correspond to lower number of failures and,
thus, lower failure costs. At the same time, higher reliability"
315,"levels result in more frequent planned replacements. Due to the
large ratio between the cost of failure and the cost of planned
replacement (15 : 1), the effect of the planned replacement costs
is offset by the high failure replacement costs. However, as
the ratio decreases this phenomenon becomes less evident. In
other words, the effect of the costs of planned replacements
becomes a signiﬁcant component and indeed increases the total
maintenance cost, see Fig. 11 (also see Tables I and II)."
316,"It is interesting to note that the total maintenance cost of the
SUDM policy always increases with increasing target reliability
levels. This is true across all the cost ratios that were tested.
We believe that this trend results from the lower amount of
degradation signals that are used to update the RLDs, thus
compromising the accuracy of the life predictions.
Higher target reliability levels imply that the stopping rule
(10) is invoked at an earlier stage. In other words, the portion of"
317,"the degradation signal that is used to update the RLD at a 95%
target reliability level is smaller than that used to update the life
distribution at a 70% target reliability level. We believe that the
reduced level of health information acquired from a degradation
signal at 95% target reliability level results in less accurate
residual life predictions compared to their counter parts at 70%
reliability. Consequently, this results in a higher number of un-"
318,"expected failures, hence more failure replacements and higher
total maintenance costs. Thus, sensory-updating is crucial to
ensuring accurate estimation of the residual lifetime.
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a Sensory-Updated Degradation-Based
Maintenance (SUDM) policy that uses residual life distri-
butions (RLDs) to evaluate predictive maintenance schedules.
The RLDs are computed using a stochastic degradation models
that can be updated in real-time using in situ degradation
signals."
319,"signals.
The updated distributions are used to revise the schedule
of maintenance routines based on the most recently observed
degradation information. A stopping rule uses instantaneous re-
liability levels to deﬁne a stopping time after which the recently
updated RLDs are used to ﬁnalize the maintenance schedule.
A simulation model of a small manufacturing facility with
ﬁve parallel workstations is used to evaluate the performance of
the proposed maintenance policy. We consider two main cost"
320,"components: cost of planned replacement and failure replace-
ment. Three cost ratios were studied. The performance of the
proposed policy policy is also compared with two benchmark
policies: a reliability-based PM policy and DM policy.
Our results show that the SUDM policy have the lowest
maintenance costs. Future research is still needed to investigate
the effect of the proposed maintenance policy on larger systems.
The research can also be extended to study maintenance-related"
321,"logistics, speciﬁcally replacement and spare parts inventory
costs. Another very important topic to be investigated within
this maintenance framework is the degradation of the sensors
that are used in CM and the ﬁdelity of the sensor signals.
